This is an R package for producing pretty caRds for special occasions. If you have the devtools package installed, you can install `caRds` from GitHub:

```
library(devtools)
install_github("rgriff23/caRds")
library(caRds)
```

### Thanksgiving

`TurkeyDay` creates a Thanksgiving turkey:

```
TurkeyDay(from = "Randi", to = "America")
```

Wish Canada a happy Canadian Thanksgiving with `canadian = TRUE`:

```
TurkeyDay(from = "Randi", to = "Canada", canadian = TRUE)
```

`ChristmasTree` generates a jolly tree with presents underneath:

```

### Valentine's Day

`OneThousandHearts` sprinkles 1000 tiny hearts about a larger heart, creating negative heart space where a romantic message can be included. If you use the `to` argument to specify the recipient of your Valentine's Day caRd, a simple message will be generated automatically:

```
OneThousandHearts(to = "Samara")
```

Alternatively, use `lines` to include a personalized message up to 4 lines long:

```
OneThousandHearts(line1 = "Roses are red", 
  line2 = "Violets are blue", 
  line3 = "If you were a Pokemon", 
  line4 = "I would choose you!")
```

### Easter

```
EasterEgg(shell = "skyblue")
```
